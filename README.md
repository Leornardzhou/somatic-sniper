# SomaticSniper

   The purpose of this program is to identify single nucleotide positions that are different between tumor and normal (or in theory, any two bam files). It takes a tumor bam and a normal bam and compares the two to determine the differences. Complete documentation is available at the project [web site](http://gmt.genome.wustl.edu/somatic-sniper/) or in the included [pdf](https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/blob/master/docs/sniper_manual.pdf).
