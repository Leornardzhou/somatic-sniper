h1. SomaticSniper

p. The purpose of this program is to identify single nucleotide positions that are different between tumor and normal (or in theory, any two bam files). It takes a tumor bam and a normal bam and compares the two to determine the differences. Complete documentation is available at the project "web site":http://gmt.genome.wustl.edu/somatic-sniper/ or in the included "pdf":https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/blob/master/docs/sniper_manual.pdf.

h2. Build Dependencies

* git
* cmake 2.8+ ("cmake.org":http://cmake.org)

h2. Build Instructions

h3. Build dependencies

* For APT-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu), install the following packages:

bc. sudo apt-get build-essential git-core cmake zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev

* For RPM-based systems (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL), install the following packages instead:

bc. sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools" 
sudo yum install zlib-devel ncurses-devel cmake

Note that for some RPM based systems (like RHEL), you will need to install cmake 2.8 or greater yourself as the packaged version is much older.

h3. Clone the SomaticSniper repository

Recursively clone the git repository

bc. git clone --recursive git://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper.git

h3. Build SomaticSniper

SomaticSniper does not support in-source builds. So create a subdirectory, enter it, build, and run tests:

bc. mkdir somatic-sniper/build
cd somatic-sniper/build
cmake ../
make deps
make -j
make test

The binary @bam-somaticsniper@ can then be found under @somatic-sniper/build/bin@. If you have administrative rights, then run @sudo make install@ to install the tool for all users under @/usr/bin@.

h2. FAQ

h3. I get lots of compile errors indicating that files are missing. How do I fix this?

SomaticSniper requires that it be linked to an old version of samtools (v0.1.6). This typically happens because you have attempted to link to a newer version. As of version 1.0.3, SomaticSniper will take care of this during the compilation process.

h3. I get errors from cmake about missing modules. How do I fix this?

SomaticSniper contains a git submodule called build-common. It contains helper modules for cmake. If you downloaded the source as a tarball from github or forgot to do a recursive clone using git, then you will not have this submodule and will see cmake errors. If you are using git, we recommend you go back and use the --recursive option when cloning the SomaticSniper repository. If you cannot use git, follow the instructions below to remedy the situation.

# Download the build-common module separately "here":https://github.com/genome/build-common/tarball/master
# Extract that tarball, and rename the directory it creates to 'build-common'.
# Replace the empty build-common subdirectory in the sniper directory with directory you just created.
# Resume following the build instructions.
